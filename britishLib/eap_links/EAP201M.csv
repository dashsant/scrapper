Thus they go to Nellore, which is nearly 500 km from Nalgonda. After his marriage with Ganga, Katamaraju ordered Manda Boyadu (Jaggayya) to feed ‘Balimudha’ (a ritual feed) to all the cattle. So he did feed. Then onwards the Boyadu was called ‘Mandahetchu’ and was conferred the privilege of being looked after by twelve sects of Yadava community. The copper plate inscription categorically mentioned that the owner of 10 cows should give one cow, the owner of 9 goats should give one lamb, the working persons should give one month income to the Mandahetchu.
