        Digital images of Inilah Kitab Kafayat al-Ghalam Fi bayan arkan al-Islam wa-Sarwathah, a text on the pillars of Islam, trade laws and inheritance laws in connection to Islam. It contains three texts: 1. Kitab Khafayat al-Ghalam about the five pillars of Islam; 2. Kitab al-Baya’, about trade laws; 3. Kitab al-Fara’idh about inheritance laws. Creator: al-Syekh Ismail Minangkabau Syekh Ismail al-Minangkabauwi.  Notes: A typographically reproduced text in black ink, unbound. The covers are missing and replaced by a thin brown paper.

All are in blue ink. In the margins we find notes also in blue ink. It is stated that the inheritance law text was finished in Mecca. The collection of the three texts was printed at Mathba’ah Dar-ihyak al-Kitab al-‘Arabiyah. In Tuhfat al-Nafis, Raja Ali Haji noted that a certain Syekh Ismail al-Minangkabauwi from Simabu in West Sumatera brought the Naqsyabandiah brotherhood to Riau. It is unclear whether these Syekh Ismails refer to the same person. Colophon: Inilah Kitab Kafayat al-Ghalam Fi bayan arkan al-islam wa-sarwathah.

There is a small red square seal of registration on page 1 in the top right-hand margin which we also find in (Daik Museum 04_002). There is also the mention of ‘nombor 35’ indicating that it was part of the court’s administration. There are three signatures and one fingerprint at the bottom of the document.
