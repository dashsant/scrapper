This photograph was exhibited at the Mizoram Gospel Centenary Exhibition in 1994. According to Pu Vanlallawma, an early primary school was established in Chhingchhip by 1911. The chief then was Hrangliana Sailo (son of Kawlhauna) who, though sympathetic to the new religion and its followers, did not himself convert to Christianity until just before his death. Pu C. Vanlallawma notes that in 1939, there was a 'rude and harsh' chief, whose rule made it difficult for local Christians. In more recent times, Chhingchhip has seen the growth of strong Catholic presence; the prominent Montford Brothers established a large school in the village in 1978. One photograph, measuring 158 mm x 87 mm. Very poor condition.

Zawna over the year, which provides a glimpse into the region's environmental history and climate. Traditional Mizo periodization in history is sometimes related to the massive landslides such levels of precipitation occasionally cause. For instance, Mizo tradition often dates events from the minpui kum, of the “year of the great landslide.” This particular record book notes that between 1912 and 1940, some 3, 533 inches of rain fell in Serkawn. Were we, for a crude but telling experiment, to extrapolate this same rate of Serkawn rainfall up to the present 2011, we might reasonably expect some 12, 491 inches of rain to have fallen on Serkawn in the last 99 years. This record is thus remarkably well preserved, considering every inch of this rain fell in its vicinity It would take some 102 Christian Hospital Serkawn Buses stacked on top of one another to match the height of rainfall that this book has been subject to over the years. One book, measuring 173mm x 207mm. Good condition.

This collection could offer researchers not only a glimpse into Tlira's own religious breakaway movement (which was the first 'indigenous' alternative to the British missionaries' efforts), but also into then contemporary culture, identity, worldview, authority, and everyday life. Tlira founded the region's first indigenous Christian church movement, which broke away from the fledgling but dominant British-missionary-led Church in 1913. Tlira's movement continues to have followers in today's Mizoram—they are labelled by others as 'Tlira Pawl' though do not seem to have any self-identification as such. Twenty seven bound exercise books, each measuring 250 mm by 168 mm. The actual text is well preserved, though the bindings on most of the exercise books are separating, with the occasional page broken free.

Pu Dara's letters contain day-to-day reports about life in Wales, some personal reflections on salvation, and notes about his involvement in church-related activities in Wales. As one of the earliest Lushai men to travel abroad, his observations and activities are interesting. For instance, he makes comments on watching the cinema in Wales, and notes how the days seem longer there than home in Lushai Hills. Approximately thirty-two separate letters, each measuring 115mm x 175mm. Generally good. The single letter dated 14/1/1913 has been torn in two, with only the upper half surviving.
