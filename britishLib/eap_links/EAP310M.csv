        The volume contains the Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 verses. It is one of the most popular books in Bhutan and deals with the concept of emptiness as its content. This book perhaps belonged to the Kanjur manuscript which was created by Ngag dbang 'Brug pa at Tshamdrak. The manuscript Kanjur was presented to a donor who sponsored the renovation and corrugated zinc roofing of the temple. The donor took the manuscript kanjur and it is said to be in the new temple in Sarpang district owned by Tharpaling Monastery. Perhaps this one and the following volume were left behind by mistake.
