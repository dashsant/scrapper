        Material about the indigenous and Islamic calendar, and propitious days for undertaking particular activities. Approximately 60 pages. Only about half was allowed to be photographed. No cover - it is kept wrapped in newspaper. The paper appears quite old, but Daeng Tiro could not offer a date. Written in black fountain pen, with names and Arabic formulae covered with red ink which has become a pink smudge over time. Page numbers have been added at different times, in pencil and blue ballpoint. From Daeng Tiro's grandfather.
