Dated with the Lakni calendrical system. This refers to the repeating 60 year cycle (see Terwiel 1981, Morey 2015), which is repeated. Thus a manuscript dated Lakni Khut Mit, could be 1695-6, 1755-6 or 1815-6. (The exact alignment of Lakni years with the Gregorian Calendar varies one or two years by different calculations). Pi Nai Lak Ni Pvk San, Din Sip during the period of Halraid Sahab. The Pvk San year is 1814-15, but the mention of Halraid Sahab (presumably Mr Holyrood) suggests a date during the British period.
